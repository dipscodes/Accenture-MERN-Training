# JavaScript Arrays and Array Methods

Arrays in JavaScript are used to store multiple values in a single variable. They can store elements of any type, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays.

## 1. Creating Arrays

Arrays can be created in two primary ways:

**Using Array Literals:**

```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
```

**Using the Array Constructor:**

```javascript
let numbers = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4);
```

## 2. Accessing Array Elements

Array elements are accessed using an index. The index starts at 0 for the first element.

```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
console.log(fruits[0]); // Outputs: "apple"
console.log(fruits[1]); // Outputs: "banana"
```
